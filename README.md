# project4
These sample Python programs show how to read in a file of i_mem.txt (MIPS instruction in hex) and simulates its architecture, outputing the result of registers, cache hit/miss and Dynamic Instruction Count (DIC).

Settings:

Instructions supported: add, sub, addi, beq, bne, slt, lw ,sw.

Registers supported: 8 registers from $0 - $7, where $0 is always 0

Data memory range: 0x2000 - 0x3000

Instruction memory range: 0x0000 - 0x1000

Deadloop at "0x1000ffff"


Files:
cache.py

mips_sim.py


Python files to simulates MIPS ISA, and cache hit/miss with limited instructions supported 

i_mem.txt


Currently contains example of an MIPS assembly file, which is located in Project4_example.asm

Simulation vs MARS:

Result of simulation after running example i_mem.txt:

Result of MARS:

As you can see, your MIPS_sim should be able to output of what the MARS' results are as well
